# 100 - Introduction

Movie-as-Code (MaC) is a play on Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) which in the computer science domain means:

"Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools."

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code


So in case of Movie-as-Code (MaC):

***"Movie as Code (MaC) is the process of managing and provisioning movies through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools."***

- Willem van Heemstra

Movie-as-Code (MaC) GUI refers to the Graphical User Interface (GUI also known as the frontend) of an application in which the user can follow a journey to get them from a perceived problem to a resolution, similar to the Hero's Journey which is the archetype of storytelling (read: movies).

**NOTE**: Movie-as-Code (MaC) CMS is the companion, the backend in the sahpe of a headless Content Management System (CMS) that manages the data that underlays the application (e.g. scene titles, characters, etc.).
